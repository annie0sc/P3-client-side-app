Module 4: P3 client-side app
44 unread replies.88 replies.
Objective

Extend your developer side to include user interaction, data storage, AJAX calls, and unit tests.
Use the examples discussed in class to get ideas.
Requirements

Create a unique, interactive, client-side app. 
Include your about & contact pages.
Update your README.md as appropriate.
Choose your stack: Will you use JavaScript or Vue.js to get and set information on your page?
Use JavaScript to get 1-3 inputs from the user and calculate some value in return.  
Add an event handler to an HTML element, e.g., a button element and its click event.
Get the inputs. Inner html will return strings. Convert to numbers if needed.
Call a simple calculation function and get the return value. 
Update an element's inner html to display the answer.
Use Local Storage or Session Storage. Store a count or other value in local storage (not session storage) to keep inputs between sessions.
Use AJAX to call a web service in response to a different user event.
Use qUnit to test your function with at least 5 sets of input values.  Always write testable functions. If you calculate, only calculate. If you manipulate the DOM, only manipulate the DOM. Write simple code. Don't combine/complicate. Test the response when invalid inputs are provided (and verify a proper exception is thrown). 
OPTIONAL: Create a full set of icons.
OPTIONAL: Add a manifest file.
OPTIONAL: Add a simple service-worker.js to create a PWA.
